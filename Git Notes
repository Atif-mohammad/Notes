git init : to initialize the git in command bash 
git add : add the file in staging area(didn't commited yet)

git commit -m "Your message here" ( here '-m' is used to pass the message into it to remember what you have commited at that specific time 
git log : is used to retain you commited hostory 
every log has a unique key which we can use for retaining the state 
git checkout "your unique number if the git commit log" you can go back to that state
